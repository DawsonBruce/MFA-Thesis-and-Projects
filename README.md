# Master's Thesis and MFA Projects (CalArts, 2013 - 15)

This repository contains a copy of my Master's Thesis, "The Algorithmic Beauty
of Music: Approaches to Computer-Aided Algorithmic Composition," as well as a
couple of python and ChucK projects which are further detailed within my thesis.

### LSys
This project uses a Lindenmayer-system for algorithmic chord generation. The
basic concept of L-Systems, and the numerous derivatives of an L-System, is
that of string rewriting – rewriting given strings according to set parameters.
“In 1968 Aristid Lindenmayer, a biologist, introduced a formal method for
modeling the development of plants. Now called L-systems, Lindenmayer's method
is a type of rewriting system, a general tool for constructing complex objects
by starting with a simple object and recursively replacing parts according to
instructions provided by a set of rewriting rules. (Frame 2015)”

### MIRKov
This project analyzes provided audio files, extracts melodic and rhythmic content 
from the audio file, and processes the extracted data through a Markov chain to
generate unique algorithmically generated melodies inspired by the analyzed audio.
The MIRKov project aims to bridge the gap between MIR practices and composition
practices, allowing users to analyze audio through MIR approaches and create
musical relations within the analysis with the use of the Markov model,
explained later in this chapter, allowing for melodic content generation via
MIDI output. MIRKov allows the composer to combine computer science with the
musical compositional process, creating a synergistic computer-aided
compositional tool for musical exploration adhering to the domain of CAAC
and exploring MIR features once reserved exclusively for musical analysis and
research.

### OEIS-to-Midi
This program connects a command-line tool to the OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of
Integer Sequences). Integer sequences are sets of recognizable patterns that
humans begin to recognize by an early age – with sequences and patterns being
found in rhythm or recognizable repetition of words, music, and numbers.
Integer sequences, such as spirals angles, which have been the subject of
musical stipulation over the years. Additionally the Online Encyclopedia of
Integer Sequences (OEIS) has been created and updated to current date allowing
a complete index of known sequences. Integer sequences are achieved through
algorithmic means, thus falling into the domain of CAAC.
